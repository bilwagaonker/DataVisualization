# Data Visualization

The dataset used in this is the famous Iris dataset. We use matplotlib and seaborn libraries to visualize the data in form of box plot, violin plot, bar graphs with the density curve and pairplots respectively.

Just plotting the data isn't really enough!
Getting relevant insights is also necessary. To help us with that I have written the following articles to understand the real essence of these data visualizations :)
